# 🚀 Flutter Portfolio — ODCL Experience

Hi 👋  
I’m **Returaj**, a **Flutter Developer** who worked at **ODCL** as the **sole mobile application engineer**, responsible for **end-to-end mobile development**, architecture, and delivery across multiple production applications.

While I owned the **entire mobile stack**, I collaborated closely with:
- **Backend engineers** (API design, data contracts, business rules)
- **Web frontend team** (feature parity, shared domain understanding)
- **Product & operations teams** (requirements, UX decisions)

This repository documents the **real-world systems, architecture decisions, and engineering challenges** I handled at ODCL.

## 🧠 Role & Responsibilities (Important Context)

**Primary Role:**  
✅ Solo Flutter / Mobile Developer

**Scope of Ownership:**
- Mobile app architecture & structure
- State management & navigation
- Performance optimization
- Feature delivery from requirement → production
- Mobile UX decisions for complex data systems

**Collaboration:**
- Worked with **backend team** on:
  - API contracts
  - Request/response models
  - Validation & edge cases
- Coordinated with **web frontend team** for:
  - Consistent business rules
  - Shared domain understanding
- Contributed **backend-level input**, though not the primary backend owner

> Mobile architecture, stability, and delivery quality were fully my responsibility.

## 🧠 Core Engineering Principles

Across all projects, I consistently applied:

- **Clean Architecture**
  - Presentation → Domain → Data
- **Feature-first modular structure**
- **Dependency Inversion & Injection**
- **Riverpod for scalable state management**
- **Reusable UI & business logic**
- **Mobile-first UX for data-heavy systems**
- **Performance-aware Flutter development**
